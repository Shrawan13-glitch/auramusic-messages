## ⚠️ Strict Update Incoming (v2.0.2)

AuraMusic **v2.0.2** will be a **strict update**.

### 🔁 What’s changing
We are switching from the old updater (**v1**) to a new updater system (**v2**).  
This allows us to deliver **smaller, device-specific APKs** (`arm64-v8a` / `armeabi-v7a`) instead of one large universal build.

### 🧩 Why this matters
- The current update system cannot safely support multiple APK URLs.
- To ensure reliable updates, all users need to move to the new updater.

### 🚨 What to expect
- One **final update** delivered via the current updater (**v1**)
- This update will seamlessly migrate everyone to the new updater (**v2**)
- The old updater API will remain available only to serve this transition

### ✅ Important
**v2.0.2 is a one-time mandatory update.**  
After moving to **v2**, future updates will be smoother and smaller.

Thanks for sticking with AuraMusic 💙

## ⚠️ Known Issues / What we messed up

- Some **home screen sections are currently not opening**  
  This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next update.

- The **home screen design may feel a bit overkill** for some users  
  It’s heavily styled and visually rich, which might not be everyone’s taste.

We’re aware of these issues and actively working on improvements.
